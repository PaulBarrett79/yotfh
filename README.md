Code for a website for Year Of The Fiery Horse (@yotfh on twitter), a musical band.

It's pretty simple and based on twitter bootstrap for layout/responsiveness.

It's built using jekyll because it's great for having templates and a simple blog/newsfeed.

IT'S ALIVE! www.yotfh.com

Next - put all the css into SASS/SCSS as a training exercise.
Next next - convert this site so it's not using bootstrap any more... hello flexbox
Next next next - something something laravel
