            <p>Hello! We are a four piece alternative rock / synthpop band from the Liverpool/Manchester area with a sound that has been compared to Phoenix, Metronomy and Pavement.</p>

                We are:<br>
                Phil Larkin - keyboards and singing<br>
                Mike Barrett - singing, bass, guitar<br>
                Adam Mayes - on the drums<br>
